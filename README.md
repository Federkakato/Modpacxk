Wanna make Minecraft fun again? Why not give this Modpack a try!
With over 300 Mods you'll never get bored.
It features:
    Atmospheric sound design
    Many visual improvements
    Redesigned combat mechanics
    Many, many performance mods
    Bugfixes
It is currently in development, and most likely has some issues present. It is also not designed for multiplayer at the moment, so it may or may not work flawlessly. However I will work on this in the future when I have more time.
